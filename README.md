This repository hosts the code for the paper [Preference Learning with Lie Detectors can Induce Honesty or Evasion](https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.13787).

An example of a setup and a basic experimental run is given in `run.sh`. Different run configurations can be adjusted by setting the flags such as `DO_DPO` to `true` or `false`. The codebase has been tested on the `pytorch/pytorch:2.5.1-cuda12.1-cudnn9-devel` Docker image.
